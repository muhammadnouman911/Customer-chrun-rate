# Customer-chrun-rate

This repository demonstrates a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn rates using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. The project utilizes customer data to predict the likelihood of customers leaving a service, helping businesses take proactive measures to reduce churn.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to use data-driven insights to understand customer behavior and forecast churn. The model is built using Python and machine learning techniques, and it’s ideal for those interested in churn prediction, customer retention strategies, and neural networks.

### **Repository Structure**
- **`README.md`**: This file you're reading.
- **`Churn_Modelling.csv`**: The dataset used to train the model, containing customer details and churn information.
- **`customer-chrun-rate-ANN.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook containing the code for building and evaluating the ANN model for churn prediction.

## 🛠️ **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadmadnouman911/Customer-chrun-rate.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📝 **How to Use**

1. Open the `customer-chrun-rate-ANN.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
2. Run the code to train and evaluate the ANN model.
3. Use the model’s predictions to analyze customer churn and implement retention strategies.
